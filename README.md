* Design patterns and idioms
  - pimpl
  - type erasure
  - composite
  - decorator
  - mixins
  - visitor (with std::variant)
  - policy based design
* Multithreading
  - TBD: atomics and locks, promises and futures, conditional variable, lock free
* Modern C++ features
  - std::variant container
  - TBD: smart pointers, lambdas, 
* Hacks and Tricks
  - macro overloading


* Libraries
  - Boost
